🚀 Full-Stack Developer | Building Scalable & Secure Solutions

I still remember the excitement of building my first project—transforming an idea into a working application. That passion has only grown stronger as I’ve evolved into a Full-Stack Developer with 1 year of experience in backend development, specializing in Flask and SQLAlchemy.

🔹 My Journey: From Code to Impact
My journey began with a curiosity about how systems work behind the scenes. Over time, I have built and optimized event management platforms, restaurant systems, and job board applications, each reinforcing my skills in:
✅ Backend Development – Designing efficient databases, APIs, and authentication systems.
✅ Performance Optimization – Ensuring smooth functionality and scalability.
✅ Problem-Solving – Turning complex challenges into clean, maintainable code.

🔹 What’s Next?
Technology is ever-evolving, and so am I. I’m currently diving deep into Cloud Computing & DevOps, mastering CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud deployments to become a specialist in building scalable, automated, and secure systems.
